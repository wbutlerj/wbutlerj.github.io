            There are very few click options on the home page for this website.
            It presents the most popular and newest product straight to the user and provides two important options.
            Learn more or Buy the product. This exempliefies Hick's law as well as Apple's exceptional design by not overwhelming the user.

            Many "nerd" websites often have problems with blasting the user with too much in one area. 
            Star Wars does a great job at providing options while keeping good spacing between them. 
            Even the nerdy design looks clean and not cluttered. This is due to the correct use of space.

           This website makes it easy to interact with its links and buttons. 
           The button and link sizes are good relative to the aspect ratio so that the user doesn't need to reach to far.
           Also as the user scrolls down and then begins back up, the navigation menu re-appears.
